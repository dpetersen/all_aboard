A (work in progress) flexible status board as a Rails engine.

**All Aboard?  What does that even mean?**  It's a status board engine on Rails.  Give me a break.  All the good names are taken.

#### TODO:

  * Document the overridden helper that you have to do, along with the fact that it sort of executes in the Engine's constants, so some stuff might not work so hot.
